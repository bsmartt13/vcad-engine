OSSIM is constantly probing the network for hosts with NMAP.  VCAD takes advantage of this continuously incoming information by doing correlation between it and a vulnerability database (a local copy of OSVDB). \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of network probing VCAD is fast.  The time it takes to run VCAD is a direct result of algorithmic complexity (not network latency).  \r\n\r\nCurrently, VCAD is designed to work within OSSIM.  However, abstracting VCAD out of OSSIM is within the realm of possibility and something we are interested in.\r\n\r\nTo use VCAD, get the repository and add the files to the following folders:\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n**github repo**\t\t---->\t**ossim directory**\r\n\r\nossimframework/*.py\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim-framework/ossimframework/\r\n\r\nvulnmeter/sched.php\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/vulnmeter/\r\n\r\nconf/main.php\t\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/conf/\r\n\r\nnetscan/index.php\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/netscan/\r\n\r\nnetscan/do_scan.php\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/netscan/\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nProject authors:\r\nBill Smartt <bsmartt13>\r\nScott Finney\r\nBin Lu","tagline":"Vulnerability Correlation and Detection Engine","note":"Don't delete this file!
