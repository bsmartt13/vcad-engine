{"body":"# vcad-engine\r\n===========\r\n\r\n## Vulnerability Correlation and Detection Engine (VCAD)\r\n\r\nVCAD is a lightweight vulnerability scanner which is intended for use inside of [Alienvault](http://alienvault.com/)'s [OSSIM](http://communities.alienvault.com/indexc.html?utm_expid=61134069-1).\r\n\r\nThe idea of this project is to decouple Network probing from analysis in vulnerability scanning.  OSSIM is constantly probing the network for hosts with NMAP.  VCAD takes advantage of this continuously incoming information by doing correlation between it and a vulnerability database (a local copy of OSVDB). \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of network probing VCAD is fast.  The time it takes to run VCAD is a direct result of algorithmic complexity (not network latency).  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to use VCAD is from within an OSSIM instance.  However, abstracting VCAD out of OSSIM is within the realm of possibility.\r\n\r\nTo use VCAD, get the repository and add the files to the following folders:\r\nossimframework/*.py -> /usr/share/ossim-framework/ossimframework/\r\n**github repo**\t\t---->\t**ossim**\r\n\r\nvulnmeter/sched.php\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/vulnmeter/sched.php\r\nconf/main.php\t\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/conf/main.php\r\nnetscan/index.php\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/netscan/index.php\r\nnetscan/do_scan.php\t---->\t/usr/share/ossim/www/netscan/do_scan.php","note":"Don't delete this file!
