{"tagline":"Vulnerability Correlation and Detection Engine","body":"## Vulnerability Correlation and Detection (VCAD) Engine for OSSIM\r\n\r\nVCAD is a lightweight vulnerability scanner which is intended for use inside of [Alienvault](http://alienvault.com/)'s [OSSIM](http://communities.alienvault.com/indexc.html?utm_expid=61134069-1).\r\n\r\nThe idea of this project is to decouple Network probing from analysis in vulnerability scanning.  OSSIM is constantly probing the network for hosts with NMAP.  VCAD takes advantage of this continuously incoming information by doing correlation between it and a vulnerability database (a local copy of OSVDB). \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of network probing VCAD is fast.  The time it takes to run VCAD is a direct result of algorithmic complexity (not network latency).  \r\n\r\nCurrently, VCAD is designed to work within OSSIM.  However, abstracting VCAD out of OSSIM is within the realm of possibility and something we are interested in.\r\n\r\nTo use VCAD, download the files to your ossim instance and run install-vcad.sh.  This will put the files in the correct places and build the lookup table (~1-2 seconds).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nProject authors:\r\nBill Smartt <bsmartt13>, \r\nScott Finney, \r\nBin Lu, ","name":"Vcad-engine","google":"UA-36919592-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
